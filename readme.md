# 🧠 LeetCode Daily Grind (Python)

This repository documents my **daily LeetCode problem-solving journey** using **Python**.  
The goal is simple and disciplined: **solve at least one LeetCode problem every day** and document my own thought process clearly.

## 📌 Why This Repository?

- To build **consistency** in problem-solving  
- To improve **logical thinking and problem breakdown**
- To maintain a **clean record of my own approaches**
- To track long-term progress rather than short-term results

This repo is not about writing the most optimal code immediately — it’s about **learning, reflection, and improvement**.
